<p><strong>Leader of Rescue Team ‚Äì NWPU Dancing Robot Research And Training Base</strong>  <em>07/2017 - 08/2019</em> 
<br /><strong>Research Topic: SLAM, Robot Localization and Navigation, Path Planning</strong>
<br />In the Rescue Robot League, robots search for several victims placed in a simulated field of a disaster site and discover and rescue them. These robots have mechanisms for both operator control and autonomous operation. They are also equipped with devices such as a camera, a temperature sensor, and a carbon dioxide sensor.
<br /><strong>Main Duties:</strong> SLAM and Autonomous Navigation, using Lidar and Hector Slam or Cartographer algorithms, combined with projects based on some open source algorithms, then optimize and adapt them to our robots.
