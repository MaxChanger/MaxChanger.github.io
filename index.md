I'm currently a first-year graduate student of Northwestern Polytechnical University([NWPU]) with the supervision of [Prof. Yuchao Dai], and I received my bachelor's degree in July 2020 from the [School of Computer Science] of NWPU, with the honor of Outstanding Graduate.

I used to be a Research Intern on topics related to 3D Scene Reconstruction and Understanding at **3D&AR Group @ MIG of [SenseTime] Research** supervised by [Jiaming Sun] and [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou] (CAD&CG, ZJU) from October 2019 to May 2020.

During my undergraduate study, I worked in **3D Vision Research Lab** supervised by [Prof. Yuchao Dai] as a Research Assistant on Lidar/Visual 3D Registration and Reconstruction, Dual Lidar calibration, etc.

I've served in the **NWPU Dancing Robot Research And Training Base - Rescue Robot Group** [Team - Explorer] for two years as a Robot Software Engineer and Team Leader since July, 2017. 
As usual, we participate in *RoboCup Rescue Robot League Regional Open Competitions*, and my main contribution is about SLAM, Robot Localization and Navigation, Path Planning, etc.
