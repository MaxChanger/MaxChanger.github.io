I'm currently a first-year graduate student of Northwestern Polytechnical University with the supervision of [Prof. Yuchao Dai], and I graduated with the honor of an outstanding graduate from School of Computer Science of NWPU in July 2020.

I used to be a Research Intern on topics related to 3D Scene Reconstruction and Understanding at **3D Vision Group @ MIG of SenseTime Research** from October 2019 to May 2020, working closely with the research group of [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou], CAD&CG, ZJU.

I worked in **3D Vision Research Lab** supervised by [Prof. Yuchao Dai] as an undergraduate Research Assistant on Lidar/Visual 3D Registration and Reconstruction, Dual Lidar calibration, etc.

I've served in the **NWPU Dancing Robot Research And Training Base - Rescue Robot Group** [Team - Explorer] for two years as a Robot Software Engineer and Team Leader since July, 2017. 
As usual, we participate in *RoboCup Rescue Robot League Regional Open Competitions*, and my main contribution is about SLAM, Robot Localization and Navigation, Path Planning, etc.
