<!-- About me -->
{% include image.html url="images/person3.jpg" caption="" width="190px" align="right" %}

I obtained my Master's degree in April 2023 from Northwestern Polytechnical University ([NWPU]), with the supervision of [Prof. Yuchao Dai], once again with the honor of Outstanding Graduate.
And I received my Bachelor's degree in July 2020 from the [School of Computer Science] of NWPU, with the honor of Outstanding Graduate.

Currently, I am a Perception Algorithm Engineer at Intelligent Driving Technology (IDT) of Baidu Inc.
I spent about a year of pleasant and fulfilling internship at the [Robotics and Autonomous Driving Lab] of Baidu Research, and working on a research topic about Scene Reconstruction and Novel View Synthesis.
Before that, I have been working very closely with [Xieyuanli Chen] on a research topic about LiDAR-Based Moving Object Segmentation at Haomo.AI.
I used to be a Research Intern on topics related to 3D Scene Reconstruction and Understanding at 3D&AR Group @ MIG of [SenseTime] Research supervised by [Jiaming Sun] and [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou] (CAD&CG, ZJU) from October 2019 to May 2020.

During my undergraduate study, I worked in [CVR-Lab] supervised by [Prof. Yuchao Dai] as a Research Assistant on LiDAR/Visual 3D Registration and Reconstruction, Dual LiDAR calibration, etc.
I've served in the NWPU Dancing Robot Research And Training Base - Rescue Robot Group [Team - Explorer] for two years as a Robot Software Engineer and Team Leader since July, 2017. 
As usual, we participate in *RoboCup Rescue Robot League Regional Open Competitions*, and my main contribution is about SLAM, Robot Localization and Navigation, Path Planning, etc.
