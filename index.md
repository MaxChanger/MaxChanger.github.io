Iâ€™m currently a senior undergraduate student in School of Computer Science of Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China. I've been working as Research Intern on topics related to 3D Scene Reconstruction and Understanding at **3D Vision Group of SenseTime Research** since October, 2019, working closely with the research group of [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou], CAD&CG, ZJU.

I worked in **3D Vision Research Lab** supervised by [Prof. Yuchao Dai] as an undergraduate research assistant on Lidar/Visual 3D Registration and Reconstruction, Dual Lidar calibration.

I've served in the **NWPU Dancing Robot Research And Training Base** for two years as a Robot Software Engineer and Team Leader since July, 2017.
We often participate in *RoboCup Rescue Robot League*, and my main contribution is about SLAM, Robot Localization and Navigation, Path Planning.
